# SERIALIZATION-AND-DESERIALIZATION-OF-JSON-DATA-IN-.NET

1. You implement an application where you have the contact information of your team. All the information is in file myTeam.json, and you have saved it in your local hard drive. 
In your application before any changes, you first deserialize the JSON data into a generic list of objects. This means (for example) that it enables you to modify (add, remove) your data in a familiar way – the way you have always done it using C#. In the end (after adding, modifying…), serialize your generic list of objects back to JSON data and save it to your Json file myTeam.json.

Your user interface should look like this:

Enter 1 if you want to show all.
Enter 2 if you want to add a new team member.
Enter 3 if you want to modify information.
Enter 4 if you want to remove information.
Enter 5 if you want to do nothing.
	


IN THIS PROGRAM I BUILD A  USER INTERACTIVE PROGRAM WHERE USER CAN VIEW , MODIFY, ADD, REMOVE AND DO NOTHING . USER CAN ADD, MODIFY INFORMATIONS OF MY PLAYERS LIKE WE CAN ADD OR REMOVE PLAYER, WE CAN ADD DATE OF BIRTH, EMAIL, PHONENUMBERS.
